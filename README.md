# hexagoals

Enough people asked me about this (ok, just my mom) that I decided to make a little read me. This is something I noticed my cousin Anna Warren doing a couple years ago on an unnamed social media site. She posted an image of a sheet of paper with a square grid on it, in some of the squares she had activities written that she had wanted to do during the year with the number of times she wanted to do them. In the adjacent squares she marked off each time she did the thing. I liked the idea so I joined in. The following year I thought maybe we should try hexagons, because HEXAGONS AMIRITE? 

I asked Anna why she started it, and she said, "I love lists, and I wanted some sort of visual representation of my progress. I TRY to use the goals as a check-in, as a way of monitoring the things that I am actually prioritising vs the things I say are important to me. Not as a way of proving my failings to myself. I guess you could say I invented it, but that sounds grandiose."

Well, we're ok with grandiose, especially since she used this system to [START HER OWN FRIGGIN' BUSINESS](http://www.tactilecraftworks.com/) and BUY A LASER CUTTER. (PEW! PEW! PEW!)

## suggestions

### how to do it

1. Find a printable grid online and download it. I like this [hexagon graph paper PDF](http://www.printablepaper.net/preview/hexagon-portrait-letter-2), but anything with about one-half to one inch spacing should suffice.   
2. Print it out!
3. Fill it in. Have fun and use colors. 
4. Share it! [Submit an issue on this repo](https://github.com/carodew/hexagoals/issues/new) or post it to social media and be the envy (or annoyance) of your friends!

### Filling it out

1. I prefer to set goals that feed my soul, are fun, or help me grow as a person. I recommend avoiding goals that are driven by guilt or that make me feel bad about myself, or that will eventually make me feel guilty if I miss a few. That means I avoid goals related to: 
  * weight loss (Ugh, no. Don't do it). 
  * unsustainably hard core fitness plans
  * All the Things goals
  * Goals that are too dependent on things I can't control to accomplish
  * Drastic lifestyle changes (little adjustments stick better.)
  * Goals that require spending a lot of money

2. Each goal should be a discrete action that can be completed. Go camping 2x can be completed. 'Camp more' is a bit too vague. 
3. Don't worry about filling in every space on the page. You can add things (or subtract them) as you go. Or you can leave them blank. The number of spaces on the page is completely arbitrary. You get to decide how much or how little you want to do. 
 
### As you go

1. Put it up on your fridge (or somewhere else where you'll see it frequently) and fill in the spaces as you accomplish them.
2. Hooray! 

### End of year or other arbitrary period of time 

1. Look at it again and celebrate what you did! 
2. Honor the empty spaces. You can't predict all that will happen in a year. You may have been injured or had to take an unexpected trip. Maybe you set your sights too high. The important thing isn't to complete it perfectly, but to encourage yourself to try some things you might not have otherwise. The empty spaces only represent the other things you did but didn't track.
3. Toss it. Let go of the old one to make room for something new.
